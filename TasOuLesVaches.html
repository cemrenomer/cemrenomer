<p>In "T'as Où les Vaches," the artist delves into the intricate being of Switzerland's Valais canton's political and social landscape. Through a visually compelling exploration, the work captures the essence of the region, utilizing the symbolism of the Dala river to reflect both division and unity between the upper and lower Valais.</p>

<p>T'as Où les Vaches features 13 cooking papers, each crumpled and stitched with a bold red thread, representing a district of the Valais canton. The seemingly futile act of crumpling the papers, followed by stitching over the resulting creases carries a metaphorical weight—no stitches were truly necessary as nothing was torn. </p>

<p>This choice of stitching serves as a nuanced commentary on the "Fête de Finges." Originally conceived as a day of remembrance for the soldiers from Valais(From both sides) who perished in the "Bataille de Finges," the event sought to mend perceived divisions between the lower and upper Valais, uniting them under the common identity of being Valaisan.</p>
<p>However, over time, the commemoration evolved into a lively carnival, complete with food trucks and festivities. This transformation sparked a subtle questioning by the artist. Despite the historical battle, Valais remained Valais, and the need for an orchestrated celebration of Valaisan identity came into question. The stitches in the artwork, highlighting intact creases, symbolize the unnecessary nature of the "Fête de Finges" and the creation of Valaisan identity—no tearing occurred, and the essence of Valais endured without the need for orchestrated unity celebrations.</p>

<p>"T'as Où les Vaches" invites observers to engage with the nuanced layers of Valais's history and question the necessity of deliberate attempts to mend perceived divisions. Through a visually striking and conceptually rich approach, the exhibition prompts a dialogue on the collective memory, resilience, and the evolving identity of the Valais canton.</p>
