<p> “I Am Sorry” is a GIF/poem where the repeated sentence “i am sorry” forms the outline of an orchid flower, complete with buds that have yet to bloom, with the phrase moving around the outline. This work emerges from a personal experience of the artist, symbolizing themes of care, loneliness, and regret.</p>
<p>The artist’s journey began with an orchid sent to her shortly after she moved to Switzerland, a time marked by isolation and solitude as she adjusted to a new environment without knowing anyone. A white orchid was sent to her by the artist’s mother, and over time became a silent companion during those early months of transition. As she started to find her footing, the orchid, despite her earnest efforts to care for it, eventually withered and died.</p>
<p>The artist’s attempts to save the orchid involved desperate searches for solutions, wanting to provide care. This experience later gained new layers of meaning with her mother’s diagnosis of depression. The artist now perceives the orchid as a symbol of her mother, and the feelings of helplessness resurfacing.</p>
<p>In “I Am Sorry,” the repetition of the phrase “i am sorry” creates the visual structure of the orchid. Each line of text not only forms the image but also conveys the emotional weight of the artist’s regret and sorrow. The phrase becomes a sort of “Mantra”, as she keeps writing it over and over like a student being punished. The phrases move around the outline, driving inspiration from the big electronic boards which can be found in the trademarket, where we can observe a constant movement, shifting. The buds that remain unopened represent unfulfilled potential and the lingering hope that care and love might eventually lead to blossoming.</p>
<p>This work is a meditation on the complexities of caregiving and the intertwined feelings of guilt, sorrow, and hope. It invites viewers to reflect on their own experiences with care, loss, and the sometimes overwhelming responsibility of tending to those we love. The orchid, as both a fragile flower and a metaphor for a loved one, represents the delicate balance between life, care, and the inevitability of mortality</p>
