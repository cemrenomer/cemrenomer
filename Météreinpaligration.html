<p>"Météreinpaligration" is a site-specific installation, its essence woven from twelve QR codes, each a gateway to a unique track resonating with "Gisele." This auditory journey intertwines with 3D printed objects. However, it is the artist's poignant encounter with a departed soul named "Gisele" that ignites the transformative juxtaposition.</p>
<p>Driven by an ardent desire to transcend mortality's confines, Gisele yearned for a return from the realm of the deceased. Her fervent longing found expression in twelve distinct narratives, encapsulated within the individual QR codes. Through these encoded tales, Gisele articulates her manifold motivations for seeking reincarnation, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in her deeply personal journey of resurfacing from the veils of oblivion.</p>
<p>Enveloping the narrative of "Gisele" are the 3D modeled objects using "Blender", fragments of her former living space in the world that currently envelops us. With delicate precision, the artist brings to life the essence of Gisele's earthly abode, creating a tangible bridge between the ethereal and the corporeal. Each object embodies Gisele's presence, resonating with her longing, memories, and aspirations.</p>

<p>Embedded within the very fabric of "Météreinpaligration" lies the evocative power of the word itself—a symphony of linguistic components uniting "Palingenesia," "Metempsychosis," "Reincarnation," and "Migration." These four terms, bearing kinship in their semantic resonance, converge to evoke the profound concept of rebirth. Their collective presence, carefully intertwined, prompts the artist to ponder the parallels between these lexical constructs and the intricate nature of reincarnation.</p>
<p>Within this sophisticated installation, visitors are beckoned into a realm where art and introspection converge. Through the amalgamation of sound, visual representation, and the tangible remnants of Gisele's past existence, a profound dialogue unfolds, probing the boundaries of mortality and the ceaseless cycle of transformation. "Météreinpaligration" stands as a testament to the artist's exploration of the human spirit, inviting viewers to contemplate the eternal dance between life and death, and the indomitable yearning for renewal that lies dormant within us all.</p>
