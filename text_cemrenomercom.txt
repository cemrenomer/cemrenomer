"Météreinpaligration" is a site-specific installation, its essence woven from twelve QR codes, each a gateway to a unique track resonating with "Gisele." This auditory journey intertwines with 3D printed objects. However, it is the artist's poignant encounter with a departed soul named "Gisele" that ignites the transformative juxtaposition.

Driven by an ardent desire to transcend mortality's confines, Gisele yearned for a return from the realm of the deceased. Her fervent longing found expression in twelve distinct narratives, encapsulated within the individual QR codes. Through these encoded tales, Gisele articulates her manifold motivations for seeking reincarnation, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in her deeply personal journey of resurfacing from the veils of oblivion.

Enveloping the narrative of "Gisele" are the 3D modeled objects using "Blender", fragments of her former living space in the world that currently envelops us. With delicate precision, the artist brings to life the essence of Gisele's earthly abode, creating a tangible bridge between the ethereal and the corporeal. Each object embodies Gisele's presence, resonating with her longing, memories, and aspirations.

Embedded within the very fabric of "Météreinpaligration" lies the evocative power of the word itself—a symphony of linguistic components uniting "Palingenesia," "Metempsychosis," "Reincarnation," and "Migration." These four terms, bearing kinship in their semantic resonance, converge to evoke the profound concept of rebirth. Their collective presence, carefully intertwined, prompts the artist to ponder the parallels between these lexical constructs and the intricate nature of reincarnation.

Within this sophisticated installation, visitors are beckoned into a realm where art and introspection converge. Through the amalgamation of sound, visual representation, and the tangible remnants of Gisele's past existence, a profound dialogue unfolds, probing the boundaries of mortality and the ceaseless cycle of transformation. "Météreinpaligration" stands as a testament to the artist's exploration of the human spirit, inviting viewers to contemplate the eternal dance between life and death, and the indomitable yearning for renewal that lies dormant within us all.

At the heart of various definitions attributed to virtuality lies "possible existence." It is within this expansive realm that this installation emerges—a virtual airport, standing as a demonstration to the interplay between the tangible and intangible.

This immersive space exists not as a physical airport per se, but rather as an evocative representation, an echo that alludes to its actual counterpart. Within its confines, traces and echoes of familiar elements resonate, subtly evoking the ambience of an airport experience. An ensemble of metal bars, reminiscent of those typically encountered at check-in counters, serves as a reminder of the connective threads between the virtual and the tangible.

However, in contrast to the rigid rules and obligations of the physical realm, this virtual manifestation defies convention. The customary lines etched upon the floor, which dictate the prescribed path within a traditional airport, become a mere suggestion. Here, freedom reigns supreme, granting visitors the liberty to traverse this simulated space without the imposition of mandated directions.

In this construct, the virtual airport becomes an embodiment of possibility—an exploration of alternative dimensions. It challenges the conventional understanding of physicality and invites contemplation on the fluid boundaries that delineate our perceptions of existence. By harnessing the power of virtuality, this creation sparks introspection, questioning the very essence of reality and the transformative potential of our perceptions.

Within the realm of the virtual airport, visitors are presented with a unique opportunity—an encounter with an imagined reality that hints at the familiar, yet defies the constraints of traditional norms. It is a space where the intangible finds expression, where possibilities unfold, and where the freedom to navigate transcends the confines of prescribed paths. Here, the virtual and the possible coalesce, guiding us to reimagine the very nature of existence itself.

Driven a phobia of drowning, the artist ventured into the realm of The Sims 3, seeking solace in the creation of a simulated apocalyptic narrative. In this digital playground of boundless possibilities, they fashioned an intricate tapestry that would elicit a profound atmospheric resonance, drawing upon the symphony of water's ethereal echoes as their artistic medium.

Within the constructed world of The Sims 3, the artist embarked on a journey to simulate a dystopian reality, a vivid reflection of their own fear, crafted to engage both the senses and the psyche. Every aspect of this digital creation was calibrated to resonate with the essence of their phobia, immersing the artist and any observers in an experiential realm that bridged the realms of the real and the imagined.

Utilizing Adobe Audition, the artist navigated the intricate domain of sound manipulation, weaving together a rich tapestry of multifarious aquatic echoes. These auditory reverberations were transfigured, molding them into a symphony that transcended their original form, captivating the imagination and evoking a profound emotional response. The resulting composition became an auditory object in which the artist embarked upon an endeavor to infuse rhythmic structure into the irregular cadence of captured water sounds. In this evocative exploration, the fluid symphony became a canvas upon which the artist sought to impose a sense of order, a resolute endeavor to discern patterns within the formless realm of sonic turbulence.


Through the interference of technology, the artist charted a path towards catharsis and a space where the ethereal essence of water's echoes became a conduit for introspection. Thus, in the artist's quest for rhythmic coherence, the irregular beats of captured water sounds found purpose and direction. It was a manifestation that mirrored the eternal human desire to find meaning and resonance within the chaotic fabric of existence—a testament to the transformative power of creative vision, as it illuminates the path towards harmony amidst the enigmatic symphony of life.

GREGORY, DERIVING FROM “GREGORIUS” MEANS 
WATCHFUL, ALERT.
THEIR NAME IS GREGORY, BUT EVERYTIME ANOTHER GREGORY APPEARS, THE
 ORIGINAL ONE DIES A 
LITTLE MORE.
THE MORE UNDETECTABLE THE FIRST GREGORY IS, THE MORE IT BECOMES A CLICHÉ ROBOT, AND GETS STRIPPED FROM HIS INDIVIDUALITY.



Rooted in the etymology of "Gregorius," the name Gregory carries a profound connotation— vigilance and awareness. However, within the intricate existence of "Greg", a paradox unfolds. As additional iterations of the name Gregory emerge, a peculiar phenomenon transpires, wherein the original bearer of the name gradually diminishes, losing a fragment of their essence with each appearance.

In this curious dance of namesakes, the once-distinctive identity of the initial Gregory is inexorably eroded. With every subsequent apparition, the very fabric of their being grows fainter, overshadowed by the proliferation of their counterparts. Paradoxically, as the first Gregory endeavors to remain inconspicuous, their individuality slowly fades, akin to a cliché automaton bereft of unique attributes.

It is a poignant reflection on the delicate interplay between identity and perception. As the first Gregory strives to evade detection, an unintended consequence befalls them—a gradual metamorphosis into an archetype, their distinctive qualities gradually stripped away. In this existential struggle, the more they fade into obscurity, the more they become a mere representation of a stereotype, losing the vibrant essence of their individuality.


Within the enigmatic realm of human existence, the name Gregory becomes entangled in a web of paradoxical fate. The very essence of vigilance and alertness encapsulated by their name becomes a delicate tightrope walk, where the more they evade notice, the more they risk dissolution into the realm of the mundane.

A SHELL CAN BE A SIGN OF HOME, A SAFE SPACE.

IT IS UP TO THE SPECTATOR TO BE LED OR NOT, 
DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH THEY FEEL THE NEED TO BE GUIDED.


Shell Shock  is  an site-specific installation that had been installed in the same room as Echappatoire(2019), and it was an intentional choice; it was a representation of the artist's resilience. 
    
At the very entry of the room, the spectator  could see that there was an added-on piece of white wall that made the spectator have to bend over to be able to get inside. Once they are in, they’re greeted with a white, rather small room with just a couple of objects in it. Right over their heads, on top of the entry, stands a small speaker that starts describing the room they’re in, and what they can be doing at the moment. Then, the voice starts giving commands, such as to place themselves on top of the white surface at the middle of the room, and close their eyes.

 If the spectator choses to do so, and not watch the screen that stands before them, they miss out on an “Easteregg”. If they aren’t too caught up in the narrator’s story or commands, and feel comfortable enough to look around, they can also stumble upon another easteregg, hidden inside the surface they’re supposed to sit on. 







The immersive experience "Shell Shock" is an invitation to the spectator, granting them a medium in choosing their path within the installation's narrative trajectory. It is a exemplification to the individual's inherent desire for guidance and the nuanced balance between surrendering to direction or forging an independent course.

Intentionally positioned in the same space as "Echappatoire" (2019), the site specific installation "Shell Shock" represents the visual embodiment of the artist's resilience. As the spectator enters, their attention is immediately drawn to an appended piece of white wall, purposefully placed to require a stooped posture for entry. Within this restricted physicality, a realm of exploration unfolds: 

Above the entrance, an unobtrusive speaker awaits, positioned to guide the spectator's journey within this confined space. Its disembodied voice initiates a vivid description of the room's highlights, offering suggestions and insights into potential actions to undertake. Gradually, the voice assumes a commanding presence, directing the spectator to position themselves upon the central white surface and beckoning them to close their eyes in compliance.

Yet, herein lies the crux of choice—the spectator, in their agency, can opt to heed the voice's commands, thereby engaging fully with its narrative trajectory. However, by solely succumbing to the narrator's story or directives, they unknowingly forgo an intriguing hidden element—an elusive "Easteregg" concealed from their view. Should the spectator, unencumbered by the allure of the narrator's tale, choose to explore their surroundings and cast their gaze beyond the screen before them, a discovery of another concealed object awaits, subtly embedded within the surface they are meant to rest upon.

This interplay of choice and discovery within "Shell Shock" grants spectators the opportunity to navigate the installation in alignment with their individual inclinations. It highlights the delicate happening between surrendering to external guidance and creating an independent path. In the realm of this immersive experience, the discerning spectator can unveil hidden gems, whether by complying the narrative's pull or embracing the unexpected allure of their surroundings—a testament to the vast potential for personal revelation that lies beyond prescribed trajectories.

Curation, by definition means healing, protecting. In this work the artist takes the place of a "Curator", to curate the sticks she found on the beach. She cares for the sticks, displays them in a certain manner, to make them more "important" than the other millions of sticks laying in the beach. This is a nod to the role of the contemporary curator. 




Curation, as defined, embodies the virtues of restoration and guardianship. In this artistic endeavor where the artist assumes the mantle of a 'Curator,' delicately selecting and orchestrating the driftwood, dried seaweeds and bush pieces discovered along the shore.

Milk Puzzleis a moving sculpture that takes the form of an algebraic balance, with the presence of an engineered motor affixed to its rear. This motor, programmed to move in an unpredictable manner, consigns the apparatus to an enduring struggle with the ephemeral equilibrium that exists between the 'pros' and 'cons.' With unwavering determination, it embarks on endeavors, yet remains ensnared within the labyrinthine corridors of perpetual ambivalence. Each decision, executed with deliberate precision, unfolds as a carefully choreographed dance of hesitation.

Even during those fleeting moments when it manages to attain a fragile equipoise, it chooses to disrupt its own harmony.

Through the interference of technology, the artist charted a path towards catharsis and a space where the ethereal essence of water's echoes became a conduit for introspection. Thus, in the artist's quest for rhythmic coherence, the irregular beats of captured water sounds found purpose and direction. It was a manifestation that mirrored the eternal human desire to find meaning and resonance within the chaotic fabric of existence—a testament to the transformative power of creative vision, as it illuminates the path towards harmony amidst the enigmatic symphony of life.

GREGORY, DERIVING FROM “GREGORIUS” MEANS 
WATCHFUL, ALERT.
THEIR NAME IS GREGORY, BUT EVERYTIME ANOTHER GREGORY APPEARS, THE
 ORIGINAL ONE DIES A 
LITTLE MORE.
THE MORE UNDETECTABLE THE FIRST GREGORY IS, THE MORE IT BECOMES A CLICHÉ ROBOT, AND GETS STRIPPED FROM HIS INDIVIDUALITY.



Rooted in the etymology of "Gregorius," the name Gregory carries a profound connotation— vigilance and awareness. However, within the intricate existence of "Greg", a paradox unfolds. As additional iterations of the name Gregory emerge, a peculiar phenomenon transpires, wherein the original bearer of the name gradually diminishes, losing a fragment of their essence with each appearance.

In this curious dance of namesakes, the once-distinctive identity of the initial Gregory is inexorably eroded. With every subsequent apparition, the very fabric of their being grows fainter, overshadowed by the proliferation of their counterparts. Paradoxically, as the first Gregory endeavors to remain inconspicuous, their individuality slowly fades, akin to a cliché automaton bereft of unique attributes.

It is a poignant reflection on the delicate interplay between identity and perception. As the first Gregory strives to evade detection, an unintended consequence befalls them—a gradual metamorphosis into an archetype, their distinctive qualities gradually stripped away. In this existential struggle, the more they fade into obscurity, the more they become a mere representation of a stereotype, losing the vibrant essence of their individuality.


Within the enigmatic realm of human existence, the name Gregory becomes entangled in a web of paradoxical fate. The very essence of vigilance and alertness encapsulated by their name becomes a delicate tightrope walk, where the more they evade notice, the more they risk dissolution into the realm of the mundane.

A SHELL CAN BE A SIGN OF HOME, A SAFE SPACE.

IT IS UP TO THE SPECTATOR TO BE LED OR NOT, 
DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH THEY FEEL THE NEED TO BE GUIDED.


Shell Shock  is  an site-specific installation that had been installed in the same room as Echappatoire(2019), and it was an intentional choice; it was a representation of the artist's resilience. 
    
At the very entry of the room, the spectator  could see that there was an added-on piece of white wall that made the spectator have to bend over to be able to get inside. Once they are in, they’re greeted with a white, rather small room with just a couple of objects in it. Right over their heads, on top of the entry, stands a small speaker that starts describing the room they’re in, and what they can be doing at the moment. Then, the voice starts giving commands, such as to place themselves on top of the white surface at the middle of the room, and close their eyes.

 If the spectator choses to do so, and not watch the screen that stands before them, they miss out on an “Easteregg”. If they aren’t too caught up in the narrator’s story or commands, and feel comfortable enough to look around, they can also stumble upon another easteregg, hidden inside the surface they’re supposed to sit on. 







The immersive experience "Shell Shock" is an invitation to the spectator, granting them a medium in choosing their path within the installation's narrative trajectory. It is a exemplification to the individual's inherent desire for guidance and the nuanced balance between surrendering to direction or forging an independent course.

Intentionally positioned in the same space as "Echappatoire" (2019), the site specific installation "Shell Shock" represents the visual embodiment of the artist's resilience. As the spectator enters, their attention is immediately drawn to an appended piece of white wall, purposefully placed to require a stooped posture for entry. Within this restricted physicality, a realm of exploration unfolds: 

Above the entrance, an unobtrusive speaker awaits, positioned to guide the spectator's journey within this confined space. Its disembodied voice initiates a vivid description of the room's highlights, offering suggestions and insights into potential actions to undertake. Gradually, the voice assumes a commanding presence, directing the spectator to position themselves upon the central white surface and beckoning them to close their eyes in compliance.

Yet, herein lies the crux of choice—the spectator, in their agency, can opt to heed the voice's commands, thereby engaging fully with its narrative trajectory. However, by solely succumbing to the narrator's story or directives, they unknowingly forgo an intriguing hidden element—an elusive "Easteregg" concealed from their view. Should the spectator, unencumbered by the allure of the narrator's tale, choose to explore their surroundings and cast their gaze beyond the screen before them, a discovery of another concealed object awaits, subtly embedded within the surface they are meant to rest upon.

This interplay of choice and discovery within "Shell Shock" grants spectators the opportunity to navigate the installation in alignment with their individual inclinations. It highlights the delicate happening between surrendering to external guidance and creating an independent path. In the realm of this immersive experience, the discerning spectator can unveil hidden gems, whether by complying the narrative's pull or embracing the unexpected allure of their surroundings—a testament to the vast potential for personal revelation that lies beyond prescribed trajectories.

Curation, by definition means healing, protecting. In this work the artist takes the place of a "Curator", to curate the sticks she found on the beach. She cares for the sticks, displays them in a certain manner, to make them more "important" than the other millions of sticks laying in the beach. This is a nod to the role of the contemporary curator. 




Curation, as defined, embodies the virtues of restoration and guardianship. In this artistic endeavor where the artist assumes the mantle of a 'Curator,' delicately selecting and orchestrating the driftwood, dried seaweeds and bush pieces discovered along the shore. The artist tends to these humble fragments, arranging them in a deliberate frame, thus displaying them with an elevated eminence amidst the multitudes of their sandy peers. This symbolic gesture serves as a neutural gesture to the nuanced role of the modern curator.

About me : 

Cemre Nomer is a Turkish born artist for whom visual arts that has been part of their life since childhood. In 2018, they embarked on a formative journey by enrolling in École de Design et Haute École d'Art du Valais. This educational experience culminated in the acquisition of their diploma in 2021.

Since earning their diploma, Cemre lives and works in nothern Switzerland. Their body of work is characterized by its versatility. Themes such as death, virtuality, artificial intelligence, lies, and identity serve as the foundation upon which their expression bases itself on, inviting viewers to engage with the different narratives existing in each creation.

"Météreinpaligration" is an installation composed of 12 QR codes which each consist of different soundtracks on "Giselle" with a juxtaposition of objects from a room printed with a 3D printer. This juxtaposition is inspired by a real personal encounter that the artist experienced with a dead person named "Gisèle".

GISÈLE WANTED TO COME BACK FROM THE DEAD, AND SHE HAD 12 DIFFERENT REASONS FOR IT. EACH QR CODE CONTAINS ONE OF HER 
STORIES, WHERE SHE TELLS HER MOTIVES FOR COMING BACK.THE MODELED OBJECTS BELONG TO HER
LIVING ROOM FROM THIS REALITY THAT 
SURROUNDS US.

The word "Metereinpaligration" is made up of 4 different words;

"Palingenesia" / "Metempsychosis" / "Reincarnation" / "Migration"

which are all of the same lexical field, and which mean similar things. By seeing them together, the artist thought to themself that there might be a parallel between these group of words and reincarnation itself.



**************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************



"Météreinpaligration" is a site-specific installation, its essence woven from twelve QR codes, each a gateway to a unique track resonating with "Gisele." This auditory journey intertwines with 3D printed objects. However, it is the artist's poignant encounter with a departed soul named "Gisele" that ignites the transformative juxtaposition.

Driven by an ardent desire to transcend mortality's confines, Gisele yearned for a return from the realm of the deceased. Her fervent longing found expression in twelve distinct narratives, encapsulated within the individual QR codes. Through these encoded tales, Gisele articulates her manifold motivations for seeking reincarnation, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in her deeply personal journey of resurfacing from the veils of oblivion.

Enveloping the narrative of "Gisele" are the 3D modeled objects using "Blender", fragments of her former living space in the world that currently envelops us. With delicate precision, the artist brings to life the essence of Gisele's earthly abode, creating a tangible bridge between the ethereal and the corporeal. Each object embodies Gisele's presence, resonating with her longing, memories, and aspirations.

Embedded within the very fabric of "Météreinpaligration" lies the evocative power of the word itself—a symphony of linguistic components uniting "Palingenesia," "Metempsychosis," "Reincarnation," and "Migration." These four terms, bearing kinship in their semantic resonance, converge to evoke the profound concept of rebirth. Their collective presence, carefully intertwined, prompts the artist to ponder the parallels between these lexical constructs and the intricate nature of reincarnation.

Within this sophisticated installation, visitors are beckoned into a realm where art and introspection converge. Through the amalgamation of sound, visual representation, and the tangible remnants of Gisele's past existence, a profound dialogue unfolds, probing the boundaries of mortality and the ceaseless cycle of transformation. "Météreinpaligration" stands as a testament to the artist's exploration of the human spirit, inviting viewers to contemplate the eternal dance between life and death, and the indomitable yearning for renewal that lies dormant within us all.

At the heart of various definitions attributed to virtuality lies "possible existence." It is within this expansive realm that this installation emerges—a virtual airport, standing as a demonstration to the interplay between the tangible and intangible.

This immersive space exists not as a physical airport per se, but rather as an evocative representation, an echo that alludes to its actual counterpart. Within its confines, traces and echoes of familiar elements resonate, subtly evoking the ambience of an airport experience. An ensemble of metal bars, reminiscent of those typically encountered at check-in counters, serves as a reminder of the connective threads between the virtual and the tangible.

However, in contrast to the rigid rules and obligations of the physical realm, this virtual manifestation defies convention. The customary lines etched upon the floor, which dictate the prescribed path within a traditional airport, become a mere suggestion. Here, freedom reigns supreme, granting visitors the liberty to traverse this simulated space without the imposition of mandated directions.

In this construct, the virtual airport becomes an embodiment of possibility—an exploration of alternative dimensions. It challenges the conventional understanding of physicality and invites contemplation on the fluid boundaries that delineate our perceptions of existence. By harnessing the power of virtuality, this creation sparks introspection, questioning the very essence of reality and the transformative potential of our perceptions.

Within the realm of the virtual airport, visitors are presented with a unique opportunity—an encounter with an imagined reality that hints at the familiar, yet defies the constraints of traditional norms. It is a space where the intangible finds expression, where possibilities unfold, and where the freedom to navigate transcends the confines of prescribed paths. Here, the virtual and the possible coalesce, guiding us to reimagine the very nature of existence itself.

Driven a phobia of drowning, the artist ventured into the realm of The Sims 3, seeking solace in the creation of a simulated apocalyptic narrative. In this digital playground of boundless possibilities, they fashioned an intricate tapestry that would elicit a profound atmospheric resonance, drawing upon the symphony of water's ethereal echoes as their artistic medium.

Within the constructed world of The Sims 3, the artist embarked on a journey to simulate a dystopian reality, a vivid reflection of their own fear, crafted to engage both the senses and the psyche. Every aspect of this digital creation was calibrated to resonate with the essence of their phobia, immersing the artist and any observers in an experiential realm that bridged the realms of the real and the imagined.

Utilizing Adobe Audition, the artist navigated the intricate domain of sound manipulation, weaving together a rich tapestry of multifarious aquatic echoes. These auditory reverberations were transfigured, molding them into a symphony that transcended their original form, captivating the imagination and evoking a profound emotional response. The resulting composition became an auditory object in which the artist embarked upon an endeavor to infuse rhythmic structure into the irregular cadence of captured water sounds. In this evocative exploration, the fluid symphony became a canvas upon which the artist sought to impose a sense of order, a resolute endeavor to discern patterns within the formless realm of sonic turbulence.


Through the interference of technology, the artist charted a path towards catharsis and a space where the ethereal essence of water's echoes became a conduit for introspection. Thus, in the artist's quest for rhythmic coherence, the irregular beats of captured water sounds found purpose and direction. It was a manifestation that mirrored the eternal human desire to find meaning and resonance within the chaotic fabric of existence—a testament to the transformative power of creative vision, as it illuminates the path towards harmony amidst the enigmatic symphony of life.

In "T'as Où les Vaches," the artist delves into the intricate being of the Valais canton's political and social landscape. Through a visually compelling exploration, the work captures the essence of the region, utilizing the symbolism of the Dala river to reflect both division and unity between the upper and lower Valais.

The centerpiece of the exhibition features 13 cooking papers, each stitched with a bold red thread, representing a district of the Valais canton. The seemingly futile act of crumpling the papers, followed by stitching over the resulting creases carries a metaphorical weight—no stitches were truly necessary as nothing was torn. 

This choice of stitching serves as a nuanced commentary on the "Fête de Finges." Originally conceived as a day of remembrance for the soldiers from Valais(From both sides) who perished in the "Bataille de Finges," the event sought to mend perceived divisions between the lower and upper Valais, uniting them under the common identity of being Valaisan.
However, over time, the commemoration evolved into a lively carnival, complete with food trucks and festivities. This transformation sparked a subtle questioning by the artist. Despite the historical battle, Valais remained Valais, and the need for an orchestrated celebration of Valaisan identity came into question. The stitches in the artwork, highlighting intact creases, symbolize the unnecessary nature of the "Fête de Finges" and the creation of Valaisan identity—no tearing occurred, and the essence of Valais endured without the need for orchestrated unity celebrations.

"T'as Où les Vaches" invites observers to engage with the nuanced layers of Valais's history and question the necessity of deliberate attempts to mend perceived divisions. Through a visually striking and conceptually rich approach, the exhibition prompts a dialogue on the collective memory, resilience, and the evolving identity of the Valais canton.





Gli Echi: Un Laboratorio di Reincarnazione"

Panoramica:
"Echi" è un progetto artistico immersivo volto a esplorare l'interconnessione tra memoria, perdita e mondo fisico. Situato nella pittoresca Valle di Lozio, in Italia, questo progetto invita le persone della regione e altri partecipanti alla residenza a prendere parte a un'esperienza di laboratorio unica nella natura selvaggia.

Ispirazione:
Traguardando una delle installazioni precedenti dell'artista, "Météreinpaligration", il progetto mira a approfondire il tema della reincarnazione e della trasformazione. Attraverso la riflessione collettiva e l'espressione artistica, i partecipanti saranno incoraggiati ad onorare e commemorare le anime defunte dando forma fisica ai loro ricordi.

Attività del Laboratorio:
Ai partecipanti sarà chiesto di portare alcuni oggetti appartenuti a una persona deceduta, indipendentemente dal loro legame con il defunto. Questi oggetti serviranno da ancoraggi tangibili per i ricordi e le storie condivise durante il laboratorio. Guidati dall'artista, i partecipanti si impegneranno in riflessioni individuali, esplorando modi per riportare simbolicamente in vita il defunto attraverso la creazione artistica.

Processo Artistico:
Utilizzando vari mezzi come scultura, collage e tecnica mista, i partecipanti daranno forma a rappresentazioni fisiche dei defunti, infondendo loro narrazioni ed emozioni personali. Il laboratorio favorirà un ambiente collaborativo in cui le idee fluiranno liberamente, consentendo l'emergere di interpretazioni ed espressioni diverse.

Risultato:
La culminazione del laboratorio sarà una esposizione collettiva delle opere create, formando un toccante tessuto di ricordo e omaggio. Attraverso questa esperienza condivisa, i partecipanti non solo renderanno omaggio ai defunti, ma troveranno anche conforto e connessione nell'atto di creazione e commemorazione.

Conclusione:
"Gli Echi" cerca di promuovere un senso di comunità, empatia e continuità attraverso il ponte tra vivi e morti. Abbracciando il potere trasformativo dell'arte, questo progetto mira a superare i confini e a unire le persone in un viaggio condiviso di ricordo e rinnovamento.
