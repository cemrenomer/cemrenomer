<p>“LAMPS IN VIDEOGAMES USE REAL ELECTRICITY.” </p>
<p>POSTED ON REDDIT BY USER 1Ferrox,  NOVEMBER 2019<p>
<p>At the heart of various definitions attributed to virtuality lies "possible existence." It is within this expansive realm that this installation emerges—a virtual airport, standing as a demonstration to the interplay between the tangible and intangible.</p>
<p>This immersive space exists not as a physical airport per se, but rather as an evocative representation, an echo that alludes to its actual counterpart. Within its confines, traces and echoes of familiar elements resonate, subtly evoking the ambience of an airport experience. An ensemble of metal bars, reminiscent of those typically encountered at check-in counters, serves as a reminder of the connective threads between the virtual and the tangible.</p>
<p>However, in contrast to the rigid rules and obligations of the physical realm, this virtual manifestation defies convention. The customary lines etched upon the floor, which dictate the prescribed path within a traditional airport, become a mere suggestion. Here, freedom reigns supreme, granting visitors the liberty to traverse this simulated space without the imposition of mandated directions.However, in contrast to the rigid rules and obligations of the physical realm, this virtual manifestation defies convention.

<p>In this construct, the virtual airport becomes an embodiment of possibility—an exploration of alternative dimensions. It challenges the conventional understanding of physicality and invites contemplation on the fluid boundaries that delineate our perceptions of existence. By harnessing the power of virtuality, this creation sparks introspection, questioning the very essence of reality and the transformative potential of our perceptions.</p>
<p>Within the realm of the virtual airport, visitors are presented with a unique opportunity—an encounter with an imagined reality that hints at the familiar, yet defies the constraints of traditional norms. It is a space where the intangible finds expression, where possibilities unfold, and where the freedom to navigate transcends the confines of prescribed paths. Here, the virtual and the possible coalesce, guiding us to reimagine the very nature of existence itself.</p>
