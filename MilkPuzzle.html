<p>Milk Puzzleis a moving sculpture that takes the form of an algebraic balance, with the presence of an engineered motor affixed to its rear. This motor, programmed to move in an unpredictable manner, consigns the apparatus to an enduring struggle with the ephemeral equilibrium that exists between the 'pros' and 'cons.' With unwavering determination, it embarks on endeavors, yet remains ensnared within the labyrinthine corridors of perpetual ambivalence. Each decision, executed with deliberate precision, unfolds as a carefully choreographed dance of hesitation.
Even during those fleeting moments when it manages to attain a fragile equipoise, it chooses to disrupt its own harmony. It is a machine seemingly haunted by ethereal burdens, for within its weightless recipients, nothing tangible resides. Nonetheless, it continues to wrestle ceaselessly with the specter of non-existent burdens, persisting in its relentless and unceasing motions, day and night.</p>
