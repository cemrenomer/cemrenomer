<p>Inspired by a relentless cycle of Turkophobic encounters, the artist aims to talk about her experience, and ask “What am I and why does it matter so much to others?”. The “Uncanny-Valley-Ness” in the title hints to this situation of being made “A stranger to your own identity” through an exterior perspective, as well as commenting on the artist’s Turkish identity becoming a questionable, almost meta-like being through the “European” goggles.</p>
<p>Through an application made by the Turkish government, the artist found the birth and death places of her ancestors; not just the cities but also the neighbourhoods and streets. These neighbourhoods in question were screen-shotted by the artist in Switzerland through Google Maps, and added to the end of the text to create a not-so-serious parallel between her current Turkish identity and the objectification of it by the exterior gaze. </p>
