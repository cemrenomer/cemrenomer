    <p>Cemre Nomer is a Turko-Swiss multidisciplinary artist for whom visual arts has been part of their life since childhood. In 2018, they embarked on a formative journey by enrolling in École de Design et Haute École d'Art du Valais. This educational experience culminated in the acquisition of their diploma in 2021.</p>
    <p>Since earning their diploma, Cemre lives and works in northern Switzerland. Her body of work is characterized by its versatility. Themes such as death, virtuality, artificial intelligence, lies, and identity serve as the foundation upon which their expression bases itself on, inviting viewers to engage with the different narratives existing in each creation.</p>
