<h5>Le Café est un Prétexte</h5>
<h5>Chromatique Lyon & Association Gamut, Lyon</h5>
<p>"Coffee, whether as a place or as a beverage, is a quintessential actor in social life.
Deeply embedded in the city as a place for debate and thought, it is also a place of life and ephemeral, astonishing encounters in the collective imagination, fueled by films and novels. It is a place where conversations are exchanged, ranging from philosophical to trivial.
The beverage, on the other hand, crystallizes numerous cultural traditions, all of which share the common point of coffee consumption as a social act. As the writer and director Luciano De Crescenzo said, 'coffee is a pretext.' A reason for meeting and exchanging, it plays an important role in organizing our daily lives. Neighborhood cafés see regulars and passersby cross paths, and the coffee break has become a crucial ritual in the workplace. 
Through this invitation to exhibit, Gamut and Meeercredi Productions wish to offer an artist or a collective the opportunity to invest in the exhibition space of Chromatique, a cultural café nestled in the Guillotière district."</p>

<h5>LYRICAL GRAVITY</h5>
<h5>Online Exhibition</h5>
<p>« LYRICAL GRAVITY is a multiplayer VR artwork for seven spectators that approaches Virtual Reality as a happening. By speculating on a fictional kind of gravity, it makes use of pop songs and their lyrics as psychoacoustic gates for triggering embodied memories and dormant affects, while leading the users on a sensorial somatic experience into the realm of instinct, intuition and desire. »</p>
