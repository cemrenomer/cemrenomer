    <p>Concieved during their collective residency at Cittadellarte by Fondazione Pistoletto, the five artists gathered together to create a written project they would not understand entirely; the goal was not to know but to feel. Between Eleftheriya(CY), Catalina(CO/SE), Cemre(TR/CH), Gayu(ID/IT) and Lynn(LB/CA), there was no one who, let alone speak, understood eachothers’ native language; so they decided to make this “Disconnection” into a game. The rules were simple; each artist would write two sentences for the poem, and would translate the very last word(Or two) in English, the only language each artist spoke and understood. The next artist to continue the poem would have to start with the last (Translated) word, in their language, as the beginning of their part, and so went on the game. This “Game” of sorts resulted in a poem where a feeling of “Yearning” was present in each and every part throughout the poem, which made it a curious case because none of the artists could explain how it came to be so. Nothing about the poem was planned since the artists all took an intuitive approach. </p>
